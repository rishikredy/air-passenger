# air-passenger
Using historical air passenger data, I oversaw an end-to-end time series analysis project to identify long-term trends, seasonality, and travel patterns. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to deal with missing values and guarantee consistency in date formatting. To find cyclical patterns and annual passenger growth, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was carried out.

In order to precisely predict future passenger volumes, statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA were implemented. Grid search and ACF/PACF plots were used to optimize parameters. To guarantee robustness and dependability, model performance was assessed using metrics such as RMSE and MAE. Using interactive plots, historical trends and future projections were visualized to aid in airline industry strategic planning.

This project showcased expertise in forecasting, time series modeling, and the utilization of Python libraries like Pandas, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib.
